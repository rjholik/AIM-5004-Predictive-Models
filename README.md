This repository is dedicated to the AIM 5004 Predictive Models course taught at the Katz School of Science and Health. Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating field of predictive modeling and gain hands-on experience in applying these methods to various scenarios. Through a mix of lectures, assignments, and projects, I gained an understanding of the core concepts of predictive modeling, including popular techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, and ensemble methods. I hope that my work serves as a useful reference for anyone interested in gaining more insight into this dynamic and important field of study.
